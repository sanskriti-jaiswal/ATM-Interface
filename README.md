# ATM Interface – Console-Based Java Application

# Introduction
This project is a console-based ATM interface designed to provide users with essential banking functionalities such as authentication, transactions, withdrawals, deposits, and fund transfers. Built using Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, this project helped enhance my understanding of OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism while working with multiple classes.

# Project Overview
This ATM Interface application simulates the core functions of an ATM, allowing users to manage their accounts efficiently through a command-line interface (CLI). The program handles secure user authentication, transaction history tracking, and seamless fund operations, making it a practical project for learning real-world banking system logic.

# Features
✅ User Authentication – Secure login system with username and password verification.
✅ Transaction History – Keeps a record of all financial transactions for easy tracking.
✅ Withdraw Funds – Users can withdraw money from their account balance.
✅ Deposit Funds – Allows users to add money to their account.
✅ Fund Transfer – Enables money transfer between accounts.
✅ Exit Functionality – Users can safely quit the application.

# Technologies Used
Java – Core programming language.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) – Implemented using multiple classes for modularity.
Collections & Data Structures – Used to store transaction history and manage user data.

# Project Structure
The project is structured using five different classes, ensuring clean code organization and maintainability:

ATM – Core functionality of the ATM, handling transactions and operations.
User – Manages user credentials and account details.
Transaction – Stores transaction history and records.
Bank – Manages multiple accounts and fund transfers.
Main Class – Controls user interaction and program execution.
