# OIBSIP_task3
I developed a console-based ATM interface application. This complex project, which involved creating and managing five different classes, allowed me to deepen my understanding of object-oriented programming and sharpen my Java skills.

Here's a brief overview of the project:


Project: ATM Interface

User Authentication: The system starts by prompting users to enter their username and password. Upon successful authentication, users gain access to the ATM functionalities.

Transactions History: Users can view their transaction history to keep track of their financial activities.

Withdraw: Enables users to withdraw cash from their accounts.

Deposit: Allows users to deposit money into their accounts.

Transfer: Facilitates the transfer of funds between accounts.

Quit: Provides an option to exit the application.
